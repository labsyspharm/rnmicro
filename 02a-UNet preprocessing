# Image Preprocessing {#preprocess}

Images can be preprocessed by inferring nuclei contours via a pretrained UNet model. The model is trained on 3 classes : background, nuclei contours and nuclei centers. The resulting probability maps can then be loaded into any modular segmentation pipeline that may use (but not limited to) a marker controlled watershed algorithm. 

The only **input** file is:
an .ome.tif or .tif  (preferably flat field corrected, minimal saturated pixels, and in focus. The model is trained on images acquired at 20x with binning 2x2 or a pixel size of 0.65 microns/px. If your settings differ, you can upsample/downsample to some extent.

**How to install:**
1. Copy the python script, UNet model, and ImageScience toolbox to your computer. Clone from https://github.com/HMS-IDAC/UNet4Sage.git
2. Pip install tensorflow (or tensorflow_gpu with CUDA drivers and CuDNN libraries), matplotlib, scikit-image, Pillow, tifffile, Image, scipy

**How to run:**<br/>
3. Open the python script batchUNet2DtCycif.py in an editor.<br/>
4. Make the following changes to the code to reflect the locations of your data and supporting files:<br/>
-line 10 update the path to the ImageScience toolbox folder `sys.path.insert(0, 'path//to//UNet code//ImageScience')`<br/>
-line 509 update the path to the model <br/>
`modelPath = 'modelPath = 'path//to//UNet code//TFModel - 3class 16 kernels 5ks 2 layers'`<br/>
-line 515 update the path to the top level experiment folder of the data <br/>
`imagePath = 'path//to//parent//folder//of//data'` <br/>
your files should be stored in a subfolder called `registration` <br/>
-line 516 : if you have multiple samples and they have a similar prefix, add the prefix/suffix here: <br/>`sampleList = glob.glob(imagePath + '//105*')`<br/>
-line 520 : if your files have a different extension from **tif**, you can change the extension here:<br/>
`fileList = glob.glob(iSample + '//registration//*.tif')`<br/>

**some helpful tips:**<br/>
5. -line 517 - specify the channel to infer nuclei contours and centers. If you want to run UNet on the 1st channel (sometimes DAPI/Hoechst), put 0.<br/>
-line 518 - if you acquired your images at a higher magnification (ie. 40x), you may want to downsample your image so that it is more similar to the trained model (ie. 20x binning 2x2, pixel size 0.65 microns).<br/>

6. in your terminal, activate your virtual environment and run this python script:
`python batchUNet2DtCycif.py`

7. If using tensorflow-gpu, your GPU card should be found. If not, prepare to hear your CPU fan fly! 
8. The probabilty map for the contours will be saved as a 3D tif file (concatenated with the original channel) and saved in a subfolder called `probmaps. The channel index you specified for inference is saved in the filename.
